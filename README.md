JOURNAL PUBLICATION SYSTEM:

The Journal Publication System is a database-driven application developed using SQL and NetBeans IDE to streamline the management of academic publications such as journal articles and conference papers. The system implements the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tables, such as Journal and Books, and ensures data integrity through database normalization techniques. This enhances the efficiency and reliability of managing academic data.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

->SQL: For database management and implementation of CRUD operations.

->NetBeans IDE: For developing the application logic and integrating it with the database.
